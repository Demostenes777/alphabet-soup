# alphabet-soup

Being n the length of the message and m the length of the string containing the letters in the bowl, and assuming that the running time of the put and get operations over a HashMap is O(1), the running time of the proposed algorithm is:

O(n + m) 

Since m >> n, it can be reduced to

O(m)
